                    <h3><strong>About Michelle Lovrine</strong></h3><br>
                    <p>I've been obsessed with stories and great writing for as long as I can remember.  I even have a BA in English professional writing from Mount Mary University here in Southeastern Wisconsin.  Starting Lively Literature Editorial and Writing Services was just a natural extension of my personality.</p><br>
                    <p>I also have years of experience writing and editing for publications such as <i>Remodeling Today, The Irish American Post, Remodel Birmingham</i> and various client websites.  I was a staff worker for a small publisher for years, so I have a sound understanding of the publication process as a whole and what makes a great publication.</p><br>
                    <p>That knowledge transferred over to self-publishing my novel, <a href="published-works.html"><i>Eatheria</i></a>, a tome of a fantasy novel about spiritual searches, self-identity under oppression and elemental magic.  There are more sci fi/fantasy works to come.</p><br>
                    <p>I look forward to working with you to help with your writing needs!</p>
